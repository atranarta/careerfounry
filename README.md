# CareerFoundry Technical Task

This is my technical task for CareerFoundry.

**layout** from scratch using JSX/SCSS.
**Fetching** data from API and rendering it in the App.
**Dynamic Routing.** When clicked on a Course, a new page with course details opens, the url is updated, accordingly.

## Installation

* Clone this repo to your local machine using: [https://github.com/atranarta/careerfounry.git]
* Get token from [https://ipstack.com]
* Add token to .env with name ```REACT_APP_API_KEY```
* Run the project in the development mode using: ```yarn start```
* Open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in the browser. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

### What could be improved

* Responsive and cross-browser layout
* Unit and functional tests
* Build config with QA pipeline (ESLint, tests, webpack build)
